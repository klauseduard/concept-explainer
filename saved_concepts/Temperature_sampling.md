### Concept Explanation:
Temperature sampling is a technique used in machine learning to control the
level of randomness in generating predictions from a probabilistic model.
It involves adjusting a parameter called "temperature" to influence the
diversity of the generated samples.

### Follow-up Questions:
1. **How does temperature affect the randomness of the samples?**
   - Lower temperatures lead to more confident and less diverse samples, while
     higher temperatures result in more exploratory and diverse samples.

2. **Can you provide an example of temperature sampling in action?**
   - In a language model generating text, increasing the temperature parameter
     can lead to more varied and creative outputs, while decreasing it can
     produce more repetitive and safe predictions.

### Etymology & History:
The term "temperature sampling" originates from the field of statistical
physics, where temperature plays a crucial role in the behavior of systems.
In machine learning, the concept was adapted to control the diversity of
samples generated by models.

### Summary:
Temperature sampling is a technique in machine learning that adjusts a
parameter to control the randomness and diversity of generated samples.
