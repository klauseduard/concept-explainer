**DeepMind** is a company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create
computer programs that can learn and make decisions like humans do. They
develop algorithms and models that allow computers to understand and solve
complex problems.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does DeepMind use AI to make decisions?
2. Can you give an example of a problem DeepMind has solved?
3. What is the history of DeepMind?

**Answers:**

1. DeepMind uses a technique called **deep reinforcement learning** to make
   decisions. They train their AI programs by providing them with a goal and
   letting them explore different actions to achieve that goal. The programs
   receive feedback on their actions and learn from it, gradually improving
   their decision-making abilities.

2. One example of a problem DeepMind has solved is **AlphaGo**, a program that
   became the world champion in the ancient board game Go. Go is much more
   complex than chess, and it was thought to be impossible for a computer to
   beat the best human players. However, DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated the
   world champion in 2016, showcasing the power of their AI technology.

3. DeepMind was founded in London in 2010 by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and
   Mustafa Suleyman. In 2014, the company gained significant attention when
   they developed **DeepMind's AI** program that learned to play Atari games
   better than humans. Later, in 2016, DeepMind was acquired by Google's parent
   company, Alphabet Inc., and has since continued to make advancements in AI
   research.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "DeepMind" combines the words "deep" and "mind." "Deep" refers to the
use of deep learning, a subfield of AI that focuses on training neural networks
with multiple layers. "Mind" represents the goal of creating AI systems that
can think and make decisions like humans.

DeepMind was founded in 2010 by Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, and Mustafa
Suleyman. The company gained recognition for its breakthroughs in AI, including
the development of AlphaGo, which defeated the world champion Go player in
2016. In 2014, DeepMind was acquired by Alphabet Inc., and it continues to be a
leader in AI research and development.

**Summary:**

DeepMind is a company that uses AI to create computer programs capable of
learning and making decisions. They employ deep reinforcement learning to train
their AI systems and have achieved remarkable successes, such as creating
AlphaGo, which beat the world champion in the game of Go. DeepMind was founded
in 2010 and acquired by Alphabet Inc. in 2014.
