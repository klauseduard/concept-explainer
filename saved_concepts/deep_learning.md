# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on training
artificial neural networks to perform complex tasks. It is inspired by the
structure and function of the human brain. In simple terms, deep learning
involves training a computer system to learn and make decisions on its own
by analyzing large amounts of data.

Follow-up questions:

1. How does deep learning differ from traditional machine learning?
   Deep learning differs from traditional machine learning in the way it
   processes and learns from data. Traditional machine learning algorithms
   require manual feature engineering, where humans identify and extract
   relevant features from the data. In deep learning, the neural networks
   automatically learn these features from the raw data, eliminating the need
   for manual feature engineering.

2. What are some examples of applications that use deep learning?
   Deep learning has been successfully applied to various domains, including
   image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous
   driving. For example, deep learning is used in facial recognition systems
   to identify and verify individuals. It is also used in virtual assistants
   like Siri or Alexa to understand and respond to spoken commands.

Summary:

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that trains artificial neural
networks to learn and make decisions by analyzing large amounts of data. It
differs from traditional machine learning by automatically learning features
from raw data, without the need for manual feature engineering. Deep learning
has applications in image and speech recognition, natural language processing,
and autonomous driving, among others.
