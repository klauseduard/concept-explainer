# Concept of Semantic Similarity

Semantic similarity refers to the measure of how similar the meaning or
underlying concept of two pieces of text or words is. It focuses on capturing
the similarity in meaning rather than just the surface-level similarity.

## Follow-up Questions

**Q1: How is semantic similarity different from regular similarity?**

A1: Regular similarity compares text or words based on their surface-level
characteristics, such as the number of common words or their order. Semantic
similarity, on the other hand, takes into account the meaning and context of
the text or words. It aims to capture the similarity in the underlying concept
or idea.

**Q2: How is semantic similarity measured?**

A2: Semantic similarity can be measured using various techniques. One common
approach is to use natural language processing (NLP) models that are trained on
large amounts of text data. These models learn to understand the meaning and
context of words and sentences, allowing them to calculate the semantic
similarity between different pieces of text.

**Q3: Can you provide an example of semantic similarity?**

A3: Sure! Let's consider the following two sentences:

- Sentence 1: "The cat is sitting on the mat."
- Sentence 2: "The kitten is resting on the rug."

Although the words used in the sentences are different, the underlying concept
is similar: a small feline animal is in a relaxed position on a soft surface.
A semantic similarity model would be able to recognize this similarity and
assign a high similarity score to these sentences.

## Summary

Semantic similarity measures how similar the meaning or concept of two pieces
of text or words is, rather than just their surface-level similarity. It takes
into account the context and meaning of the text, allowing for a more nuanced
comparison. Techniques such as NLP models can be used to measure semantic
similarity.
