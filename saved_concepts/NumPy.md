**Concept of NumPy:**

NumPy is a Python library that stands for "Numerical Python". It provides
efficient data structures and functions for performing numerical operations
in Python. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis
because it allows for fast and efficient manipulation of large arrays and
matrices.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. Why would I use NumPy instead of built-in Python data structures like
   lists?
   
   NumPy provides several advantages over built-in Python data structures.
   Firstly, NumPy arrays are more memory-efficient and faster to process
   compared to lists. This is because NumPy arrays are homogeneous, meaning
   they store elements of the same data type, whereas lists can store
   elements of different types. Secondly, NumPy provides a wide range of
   mathematical functions and operations that are optimized for performance.
   Lastly, NumPy arrays can be easily integrated with other scientific
   libraries in Python, such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

2. Can you give me an example of how NumPy can be used?

   Sure! Let's say you have a list of numbers and you want to calculate the
   mean of those numbers. Using NumPy, you can convert the list into a NumPy
   array and then use the `mean()` function to calculate the mean. Here's an
   example:
   
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   num_array = np.array(numbers)
   mean = np.mean(num_array)
   
   print(mean)  # Output: 3.0
   ```

**Etymology and History:**

The term "NumPy" is short for "Numerical Python". It was created by Travis
Olliphant in 2005 as an open-source project. NumPy was developed to provide
efficient numerical computing capabilities in Python, filling a gap that
existed at the time. Since its inception, NumPy has become an essential
library in the Python ecosystem, widely used in scientific computing and data
analysis.

**Summary:**

NumPy is a Python library that provides efficient data structures and functions
for numerical operations. It offers advantages over built-in Python data
structures, such as memory efficiency and optimized mathematical operations.
NumPy is widely used in scientific computing and data analysis.
