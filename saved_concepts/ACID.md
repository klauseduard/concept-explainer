**ACID** is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and
Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee reliability and
consistency in database transactions.

- **Atomicity** ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible
  unit of work. Either all the changes made by the transaction are committed,
  or none of them are. There is no partial completion of a transaction.

- **Consistency** ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid
  state to another. It enforces any integrity constraints or rules defined on
  the database, ensuring that the data remains valid throughout the
  transaction.

- **Isolation** ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each
  other. Each transaction is executed in isolation, as if it were the only
  transaction running on the database. This prevents data inconsistencies and
  ensures that each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the data.

- **Durability** ensures that once a transaction is committed, its changes
  persist even in the event of a system failure. The changes are stored in a
  durable storage medium, such as a hard disk, to ensure their long-term
  availability.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does atomicity work in practice?
   - Atomicity is achieved by using transaction logs or write-ahead logs (WAL).
     Before making any changes to the database, the transaction is first
     recorded in the log. If a failure occurs during the transaction, the log
     can be used to undo or redo the changes made by the transaction.

2. Can you give an example of how isolation works?
   - Let's say there are two transactions: A and B. If A is reading data from a
     table while B is updating the same table, isolation ensures that A will
     only see the data as it was before B made any changes. This prevents A
     from seeing inconsistent or incorrect data.

**Etymology and History:**

The ACID properties were first defined by Andreas Reuter and Theo HÃ¤rder in 1983.
The term "ACID" was coined as an acronym to represent these properties.
Since then, ACID has become a fundamental concept in database systems,
providing a strong foundation for reliable and consistent data management.

**Summary:**

ACID is a set of properties that ensure reliability and consistency in database
transactions. Atomicity guarantees that a transaction is treated as a single
unit of work, Consistency ensures that the database remains valid throughout
the transaction, Isolation prevents interference between concurrent transactions,
and Durability ensures that committed changes persist even in the event of a
system failure.
