**Confirmation Bias: Simplified Explanation**

Confirmation bias is a tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms our preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. It is like wearing a pair of glasses that only allow us to see things that align with what we already think, while ignoring or dismissing anything that contradicts it.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. Why do people have confirmation bias?
Confirmation bias occurs because our brains naturally seek to validate our existing beliefs and opinions. It helps us maintain a sense of consistency and avoid cognitive dissonance.

2. How does confirmation bias affect decision-making?
Confirmation bias can lead to flawed decision-making because it prevents us from considering alternative perspectives or evidence that may challenge our initial beliefs. This can result in overlooking important information or making biased judgments.

**Example:**

Let's say a software developer strongly believes that a particular programming language is the best choice for a project. They might actively seek out information that supports their belief, such as success stories or positive reviews, while ignoring or downplaying any negative experiences or criticisms related to that language.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "confirmation bias" was coined by cognitive psychologist Peter Wason in 1960. Wason conducted experiments that demonstrated people's tendency to seek information that confirms their existing beliefs. Since then, confirmation bias has been extensively studied in psychology and has become a well-known concept in various fields.

**Summary:**

Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias where individuals selectively seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms their preexisting beliefs. It can impact decision-making by limiting consideration of alternative perspectives or evidence. The term was introduced by Peter Wason in 1960 and has since been widely studied in psychology.
