**Backus-Naur Form (BNF)** is a notation used to describe the syntax of a
programming language or any other formal language. It helps us understand how
to write valid statements in a language by defining its grammar.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. Why do we need to define the grammar of a programming language?
2. How does BNF help in understanding the syntax of a language?
3. Can you provide an example of BNF notation?

**Answers:**

1. Defining the grammar of a programming language is important because it
   allows us to understand the rules and structure of the language. It helps
   programmers write correct and meaningful code by providing guidelines on
   how to construct valid statements.

2. BNF helps in understanding the syntax of a language by breaking it down into
   smaller components. It uses symbols and rules to define how different parts
   of the language can be combined to form valid statements. By following these
   rules, programmers can ensure that their code is syntactically correct.

3. Here's an example of BNF notation for a simple arithmetic expression in a
   programming language:

   ```
   <expression> ::= <number> | <expression> <operator> <expression>
   <number> ::= <digit> | <digit> <number>
   <digit> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
   <operator> ::= + | - | * | /
   ```

   In this example, `<expression>`, `<number>`, `<digit>`, and `<operator>` are
   non-terminal symbols, while `::=`, `|`, and the characters within angle
   brackets are used to define the rules of the language.

**Etymology and History:**

Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is named after its creators, John Backus and Peter Naur.
It was first introduced by Backus in 1959 as a notation for describing the
syntax of the ALGOL 60 programming language. Later, Peter Naur refined and
popularized BNF as a general notation for describing the syntax of programming
languages.

**Summary:**

Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a notation used to define the grammar and syntax of a
programming language or any other formal language. It helps programmers
understand how to write valid statements by providing rules and guidelines on
how different components of the language can be combined.
