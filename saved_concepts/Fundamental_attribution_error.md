**Concept: Fundamental Attribution Error**

The Fundamental Attribution Error is a psychological concept that refers to our tendency to overemphasize internal characteristics (such as personality traits) and underestimate external factors when explaining other people's behavior. In simpler terms, it means that we often attribute someone's actions to their personal qualities rather than considering the situational factors that may have influenced their behavior.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. Why do we tend to focus more on internal characteristics when explaining someone's behavior?
   - We have a natural inclination to understand and make sense of the world around us. It is easier for our brains to attribute behavior to stable internal traits rather than considering the complexities of the situation.

2. Can you provide an example to illustrate the Fundamental Attribution Error?
   - Sure! Let's say you're working on a software project with a colleague. If your colleague makes a mistake, you might assume they are careless or incompetent (internal attribution) without considering that they were working under a tight deadline or had limited resources (external factors) that contributed to the error.

3. How does the Fundamental Attribution Error affect our interactions with others?
   - It can lead to misunderstandings and unfair judgments. By overlooking external factors, we may jump to conclusions about someone's character without considering the circumstances that influenced their behavior. This can strain relationships and hinder effective communication.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "Fundamental Attribution Error" was coined by social psychologists Lee Ross and Richard Nisbett in 1977. They conducted a series of experiments to explore how people explain behavior and found that individuals tend to attribute behavior to internal factors even when there are clear situational influences.

**Summary:**

The Fundamental Attribution Error refers to our tendency to attribute behavior to internal characteristics rather than considering external factors. It can lead to misunderstandings and unfair judgments in our interactions with others. The term was introduced by social psychologists Ross and Nisbett in 1977.
