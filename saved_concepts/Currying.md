**Currying** is a concept in functional programming that allows you to transform a
function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking
only one argument. This makes it easier to partially apply arguments to a
function and create new functions from existing ones.

When you curry a function, you break it down into a series of functions, each
taking one argument. The result is a chain of functions, where each function
takes one argument and returns another function that takes the next argument.
This process continues until all the arguments are provided, and the final
function returns the result.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a function `add` that takes two numbers and returns their sum:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

By currying this function, we can transform it into a sequence of functions:

```python
def add_curried(x):
    def inner(y):
        return x + y
    return inner
```

Now, we can create a new function `add2` by partially applying the first
argument:

```python
add2 = add_curried(2)
```

The `add2` function is equivalent to calling `add` with `x=2`. We can now use
`add2` to add 2 to any number:

```python
result = add2(5)  # result is 7
```

**Follow-up questions:**

1. **Why would I want to curry a function?**
   
   Currying allows you to create specialized versions of a function by
   partially applying some of its arguments. This can be useful when you have a
   function with many arguments, but you frequently use it with some fixed
   values. It also enables you to create reusable function factories that
   generate new functions with specific behavior.

2. **Can you curry any function?**
   
   Currying works best with functions that have a fixed number of arguments. It
   is less practical with variadic functions (functions that can take a
   variable number of arguments) or functions with optional arguments. However,
   some programming languages provide built-in support for currying, making it
   easier to curry any function.

**Etymology and History:**

The concept of currying is named after Haskell Curry, an American mathematician
and logician who made significant contributions to the field of mathematical
logic. Although Curry did not invent the concept, it was named after him to
honor his work in the area of combinatory logic.

Currying has its roots in the lambda calculus, a formal system developed by
Alonzo Church in the 1930s. The lambda calculus introduced the idea of
abstraction and function application, which are fundamental concepts in
functional programming.

**Summary:**

Currying is a technique in functional programming that allows you to transform a
function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking one
argument. This enables partial function application and the creation of new
functions from existing ones. Currying can be useful for creating specialized
versions of functions and building reusable function factories.
