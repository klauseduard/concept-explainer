Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns
to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives
feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions, and its
goal is to maximize the total reward it receives over time.

Follow-up question: How does the agent learn from the feedback?

The agent learns through a trial-and-error process. It starts by taking random
actions and observing the rewards it receives. Over time, it learns to associate
certain actions with higher rewards and adjusts its decision-making strategy
accordingly. This is done using algorithms that update the agent's policy, which
is a set of rules that determine its actions.

Example: Let's say we have an autonomous car learning to navigate through
traffic. The car starts by randomly choosing actions like turning left or right
at intersections. If it successfully reaches its destination, it receives a
positive reward. If it causes an accident, it receives a negative reward. By
repeatedly driving and receiving feedback, the car learns to make better
decisions and avoids accidents.

Summary: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent
learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving
feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. Through trial-and-error, the
agent learns to associate certain actions with higher rewards and adjusts its
decision-making strategy accordingly. This approach is useful in scenarios where
the optimal solution is not known in advance and the agent needs to learn from
experience.
