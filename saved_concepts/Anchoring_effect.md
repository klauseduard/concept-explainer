**Anchoring effect** is a cognitive bias that influences our decision-making process
by relying too heavily on the first piece of information we receive, known as the
"anchor." This initial information, even if it is irrelevant or arbitrary, can
significantly impact our judgments and subsequent decisions.

**Manager's follow-up questions:**

1. How does the anchoring effect apply to software project management?
   
   The anchoring effect can impact software project management in various ways.
   For example, when estimating project timelines or budgets, the initial
   information or estimate provided by a team member or stakeholder can serve
   as an anchor. This anchor can influence subsequent discussions and decisions,
   potentially leading to biased estimations or unrealistic expectations.

2. How can the anchoring effect be mitigated in software project management?
   
   To mitigate the anchoring effect, it is important to be aware of its presence
   and consciously challenge the initial anchor. Encourage team members and
   stakeholders to provide multiple estimates or perspectives, allowing for a
   more comprehensive evaluation. Additionally, using historical data or
   benchmarking can help provide a more objective basis for decision-making,
   reducing the influence of arbitrary anchors.

**Example:**

Let's say a software project manager is discussing the estimated completion time
for a particular feature with a developer. The developer suggests that it will
take around two weeks to complete. The manager, unknowingly influenced by this
anchor, may then base their subsequent planning and expectations around this
initial estimate. As a result, the manager might allocate resources and set
milestones based on the assumption that the feature will be completed in two
weeks, potentially leading to unrealistic deadlines or resource allocation.

**Etymology and history:**

The term "anchoring effect" was first introduced by psychologists Amos Tversky
and Daniel Kahneman in their groundbreaking work on cognitive biases in the
1970s. Through their research, they discovered that people tend to rely heavily
on the first piece of information they receive when making judgments or decisions,
even if that information is arbitrary or irrelevant.

**Summary:**

The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias that influences decision-making by
relying too heavily on the initial information received, known as the anchor.
In software project management, this bias can impact estimations, planning, and
resource allocation. To mitigate the anchoring effect, it is important to
challenge initial anchors, encourage multiple perspectives, and use objective
data for decision-making.
