**Markov Chain**

A Markov Chain is a mathematical model that represents a sequence of events
where the probability of transitioning from one event to another depends only
on the current state. It is named after the Russian mathematician Andrey
Markov.

In simpler terms, a Markov Chain is like a game where you move from one state
to another based on a set of rules. The rules are determined by probabilities,
and the next state you transition to depends only on your current state.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does a Markov Chain work?
2. What are the applications of Markov Chains?

**Answers:**

1. A Markov Chain works by defining a set of states and the probabilities of
   transitioning from one state to another. You start in an initial state and
   then move to the next state based on the probabilities. The transition
   probabilities are usually represented in a matrix called the transition
   matrix. To determine the next state, you multiply the current state vector
   by the transition matrix. This process can be repeated to simulate the
   sequence of events.

2. Markov Chains have various applications in different fields. Some examples
   include:
   - Natural Language Processing: Markov Chains can be used to generate
     realistic-sounding text by predicting the next word based on the previous
     words.
   - Finance: Markov Chains can be used to model stock prices and predict
     future price movements.
   - Weather Forecasting: Markov Chains can be used to model weather patterns
     and predict future weather conditions.

**Etymology and History:**

The concept of Markov Chains was introduced by Andrey Markov, a Russian
mathematician, in the early 20th century. Markov was interested in studying
random processes and developed the theory of Markov Chains as a way to model
sequences of events with probabilistic transitions.

**Summary:**

A Markov Chain is a mathematical model that represents a sequence of events
where the probability of transitioning from one event to another depends only
on the current state. It has various applications in fields like Natural
Language Processing, Finance, and Weather Forecasting.
