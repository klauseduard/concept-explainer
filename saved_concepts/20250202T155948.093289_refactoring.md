### Refactoring Simplified

Refactoring is like tidying up your code to make it cleaner and easier to
understand without changing what it does. It's like organizing your room to
make it neater and more efficient.

#### Follow-up Questions:

1. **Why is refactoring important?**
   - Refactoring helps improve the structure of your code, making it easier to
     maintain and add new features later on.

2. **When should we refactor code?**
   - It's good to refactor code when you notice it's becoming hard to
     understand or modify, or when you're adding new functionality.

#### Example:

Let's say you have a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. If you
realize that the function is too long and hard to follow, you can refactor it
by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.

### Etymology and History

The term "refactoring" was coined by Martin Fowler in his book "Refactoring:
Improving the Design of Existing Code" in 1999. It comes from the words
"re" (meaning again) and "factor" (meaning to change the structure).

### Summary

Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its
external behavior to make it easier to understand and maintain.
