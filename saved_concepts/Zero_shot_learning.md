**Concept Explanation:**

Zero-shot learning is a machine learning approach where a model is trained to
recognize classes it has never seen before during training. In simpler terms,
it's like teaching a computer to identify new objects without showing it
examples of those objects beforehand.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does zero-shot learning differ from traditional machine learning?
   - In traditional machine learning, the model is trained on a specific set of
     classes and cannot recognize new classes without retraining. Zero-shot
     learning allows the model to generalize to unseen classes.

2. What techniques are commonly used in zero-shot learning?
   - Common techniques include semantic embeddings, attribute-based
     classification, and generative models to infer relationships between
     seen and unseen classes.

**Example:**

Imagine training a model to recognize different species of animals. With zero-shot
learning, the model can correctly identify a new species, like a zebra, even if
it was not part of the original training data.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "zero-shot learning" originated in the field of computer vision and
natural language processing. It gained popularity as researchers sought ways to
improve machine learning models' ability to generalize to new tasks and classes
without explicit training data.

**Summary:**

Zero-shot learning enables machine learning models to recognize and classify
new classes without prior exposure during training. It expands the
generalization capabilities of models, making them more adaptable to novel
tasks and scenarios.
