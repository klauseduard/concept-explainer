**Overfitting** is a concept in machine learning where a model becomes too
specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data. It's
like memorizing answers for a specific set of questions without understanding
the underlying concepts.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. Why is overfitting a problem?
2. How does overfitting happen?
3. Can you give an example of overfitting?

**Answers:**

1. Overfitting is a problem because it leads to poor generalization. The
   model becomes too focused on the training data and fails to capture the
   underlying patterns in the data. As a result, it performs poorly when
   presented with new, unseen data.
   
2. Overfitting happens when a model becomes too complex or when it is trained
   on insufficient data. The model tries to fit the training data too closely,
   including noise or random fluctuations, instead of learning the underlying
   patterns. This makes the model less flexible and less capable of
   generalizing to new data.
   
3. Let's say we have a dataset of students' test scores and their corresponding
   grades. If we create a model that perfectly fits the training data by
   memorizing each student's score and grade, it will likely fail to predict
   the grades of new students accurately. This is because the model has
   overfit to the specific scores and grades in the training data and cannot
   generalize well to unseen data.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "overfitting" originated in the field of statistics and was later
adopted in machine learning. The prefix "over-" implies excessiveness, and
"fitting" refers to the process of finding a model that fits the data. The
concept of overfitting has been recognized since the early days of statistical
modeling, but it gained more prominence with the rise of machine learning and
the need to address the issue in complex models.

**Summary:**

Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too specialized to the training data
and fails to generalize well to new, unseen data. It happens when the model is
too complex or trained on insufficient data. Overfitting can lead to poor
performance and inaccurate predictions.
