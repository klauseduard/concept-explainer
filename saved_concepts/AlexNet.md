**AlexNet** is a deep learning model that revolutionized the field of computer
vision by achieving state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks.
It is named after its creator, Alex Krizhevsky.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. How does AlexNet work?
   - AlexNet consists of multiple layers of artificial neurons that process
     images. These layers learn to recognize different features in the images,
     such as edges, textures, and shapes. The final layer makes predictions
     about the content of the image, like identifying objects or scenes.

2. What makes AlexNet special?
   - AlexNet introduced several important innovations. It was one of the first
     models to use deep convolutional neural networks, which are highly
     effective at processing images. It also utilized techniques like
     rectified linear units (ReLU) for activation and dropout for preventing
     overfitting.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a dataset of images of cats and dogs. We want to build a
model that can automatically classify new images as either cats or dogs. We
can use AlexNet to train a model on this dataset. The model will learn to
identify the unique features of cats and dogs and make accurate predictions
about new images.

**Etymology and history:**

AlexNet was developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton
in 2012. It was the winning entry in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual
Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) that year. The model achieved a significant
reduction in error rate compared to previous methods, sparking a resurgence
of interest in deep learning.

**Summary:**

AlexNet is a deep learning model that excels at image classification tasks. It
uses convolutional neural networks and introduced important techniques like
ReLU and dropout. AlexNet's success in the ILSVRC competition in 2012
revolutionized the field of computer vision.
