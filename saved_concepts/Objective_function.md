**Objective function** is a fundamental concept in machine learning that helps us
measure how well a model is performing. In simple terms, it is a mathematical
function that quantifies the goal we want to achieve with our model.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. Why do we need an objective function?
2. How does the objective function affect the model's performance?
3. Can you give an example of an objective function?

**Answers:**

1. We need an objective function to guide the learning process of a machine
learning model. It provides a clear measure of success, allowing the model to
optimize its parameters and make better predictions.

2. The objective function plays a crucial role in training a model. During the
training process, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize the value of the
objective function. By minimizing the objective function, the model learns to
make predictions that align with the desired outcome.

3. Let's consider an example of a simple linear regression model. The objective
function for this model could be the mean squared error (MSE), which measures
the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The
model's goal is to minimize the MSE by adjusting its parameters, such as the
slope and intercept of the line, to fit the data as closely as possible.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "objective function" originated from the field of optimization, which
deals with finding the best solution for a given problem. It has been widely
used in various domains, including mathematics, engineering, and economics. In
the context of machine learning, the concept of an objective function has been
adopted to guide the learning process and improve model performance.

**Summary:**

In machine learning, an objective function is a mathematical function that
measures the performance of a model. It provides a clear goal for the model to
achieve during the training process. By minimizing the objective function, the
model learns to make better predictions and improve its overall performance.
