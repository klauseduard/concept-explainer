# Concept of Strategic Debt

Strategic debt refers to the intentional decision of a software development team
to take shortcuts or make compromises in order to meet short-term goals or
deadlines. It is similar to technical debt, but with a broader scope that
encompasses not only technical aspects but also strategic decisions.

## Explanation

Strategic debt occurs when a software development team makes conscious choices
to prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability and maintainability
of the software system. These choices may involve skipping certain steps in the
development process, neglecting architectural considerations, or deferring
important decisions.

The idea behind strategic debt is that by taking shortcuts or making compromises
in the short term, the team can deliver a product or feature faster, which may
be beneficial for business objectives or market competition. However, these
decisions can have negative consequences in the long run, as they can lead to
increased complexity, reduced maintainability, and higher costs of future
development and maintenance.

## Follow-up Questions

1. How does strategic debt differ from technical debt?
   - Technical debt refers to the consequences of poor software development
     practices, such as writing low-quality code or neglecting proper
     documentation. Strategic debt, on the other hand, encompasses not only
     technical aspects but also strategic decisions that prioritize short-term
     gains over long-term sustainability.

2. What are some examples of strategic debt?
   - One example of strategic debt is when a development team decides to skip
     comprehensive testing in order to meet a tight deadline. While this may
     allow them to release the product on time, it can result in the release of
     a buggy or unstable software that requires more effort to fix in the future.
   - Another example is when a team chooses to implement a quick and simple
     solution instead of investing time in designing a more robust and scalable
     architecture. This can lead to scalability issues and difficulties in
     adding new features or making changes in the future.

3. How can strategic debt impact the software development process?
   - Strategic debt can lead to increased complexity and reduced maintainability
     of the software system. This can result in longer development cycles, as
     developers spend more time understanding and working around the shortcuts
     and compromises made in the past.
   - It can also increase the risk of introducing bugs and errors, as the
     shortcuts taken may not have been thoroughly tested or validated.
   - Additionally, strategic debt can make it harder to adapt to changing
     business requirements or market conditions, as the software system may lack
     the flexibility and extensibility needed for future enhancements.

## Summary

Strategic debt refers to the intentional decisions made by a software development
team to prioritize short-term gains over long-term sustainability and
maintainability. These decisions can involve skipping steps, neglecting
architectural considerations, or deferring important decisions. While strategic
debt may provide short-term benefits, it can lead to increased complexity,
reduced maintainability, and higher costs in the long run.
