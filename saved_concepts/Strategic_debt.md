# Concept of Strategic Debt

Strategic debt refers to the consequences of making short-term decisions that
compromise the long-term success and sustainability of a software project or
system. It is similar to technical debt, but with a broader scope that includes
non-technical aspects such as architecture, infrastructure, and team dynamics.

## Follow-up Questions

1. How does strategic debt differ from technical debt?
   - While technical debt focuses on the quality of the code and its impact on
     future development, strategic debt encompasses broader aspects like
     architecture, infrastructure, and team dynamics.

2. What are some examples of strategic debt?
   - One example is when a team rushes to release a new feature without
     considering its long-term impact on the system's scalability or
     maintainability. Another example is when a project lacks proper
     documentation, making it difficult for new team members to onboard and
     contribute effectively.

3. How does strategic debt affect a software project?
   - Strategic debt can lead to increased development time and costs in the
     long run. It can hinder the ability to adapt to changing requirements,
     limit scalability, and create a negative impact on team morale and
     productivity.

## Examples

1. Example 1: Rushed Feature Release
   Imagine a software project where the team is under pressure to release a new
   feature quickly. In order to meet the deadline, they take shortcuts and
   compromise on code quality, system architecture, and documentation. While
   they may achieve the short-term goal of releasing the feature on time, they
   accumulate strategic debt. This debt can manifest in the form of increased
   maintenance efforts, decreased system performance, and difficulties in
   adding new features in the future.

2. Example 2: Lack of Documentation
   In another scenario, a software project lacks proper documentation. The team
   may have neglected to document the system architecture, design decisions, or
   important processes. This lack of documentation makes it challenging for new
   team members to understand the system and contribute effectively. It also
   increases the risk of knowledge loss when team members leave the project,
   leading to increased dependency on a few key individuals.

## Etymology and History

The term "strategic debt" originated from the concept of "technical debt," which
was coined by Ward Cunningham in the 1990s. Technical debt referred to the
consequences of taking shortcuts or making compromises in software development,
resulting in suboptimal code quality and increased maintenance efforts.

Over time, the concept of technical debt expanded to include non-technical
aspects that impact the long-term success of a software project. This broader
scope led to the term "strategic debt" to describe the consequences of
short-term decisions that compromise the overall strategic direction and
sustainability of a project.

## Summary

Strategic debt refers to the negative consequences of making short-term
decisions that compromise the long-term success and sustainability of a
software project. It encompasses not only technical aspects but also broader
aspects like architecture, infrastructure, and team dynamics. Strategic debt can
lead to increased development time and costs, hinder adaptability, limit
scalability, and impact team morale and productivity.
