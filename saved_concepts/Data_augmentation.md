**Data augmentation** is a technique used in machine learning to artificially
increase the size of a dataset by creating new variations of the existing
data. It involves applying small modifications or transformations to the
original data to generate additional samples.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. **Why do we need to increase the size of the dataset?**
   Increasing the dataset size helps improve the performance and generalization
   of machine learning models. With more data, models can learn better and
   become more accurate in making predictions.

2. **What kind of modifications or transformations are applied to the data?**
   Data augmentation techniques can include rotating, flipping, scaling,
   cropping, or adding noise to the images or text. These modifications create
   new samples that are slightly different from the original ones.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a dataset of images of cats and dogs. To augment the data,
we can apply transformations like rotating the images slightly, flipping them
horizontally, or zooming in/out. This generates new images that have slightly
different angles, orientations, or sizes. By doing this, we effectively
increase the size of the dataset without collecting more images.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "data augmentation" originated from the field of computer vision,
where it was first used to improve the performance of image classification
models. It has since been adopted in various other domains, including natural
language processing and speech recognition.

**Summary:**

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of a dataset by
applying small modifications or transformations to the original data. It helps
improve the performance and generalization of machine learning models by
providing more diverse examples for training.
