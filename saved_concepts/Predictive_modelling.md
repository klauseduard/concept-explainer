**Predictive modelling** is a technique used in data analysis to make predictions
about future outcomes based on historical data. It involves creating a
mathematical model that captures the relationship between the input variables
and the output variable, and then using this model to predict the output for
new input values.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. How does predictive modelling work?
   Predictive modelling works by analyzing historical data to identify patterns
   and relationships between the input variables and the output variable. These
   patterns are then used to create a mathematical model, such as a regression
   model or a decision tree, that can be used to predict the output for new
   input values.

2. What are some examples of predictive modelling?
   - Predicting customer churn: By analyzing past customer behavior and
     characteristics, a predictive model can be built to predict which
     customers are likely to churn in the future.
   - Credit scoring: Predictive models can be used to assess the creditworthiness
     of individuals by analyzing their financial history and other relevant
     factors.
   - Demand forecasting: Predictive models can be used to forecast future demand
     for products or services based on historical sales data and other
     influencing factors.

**Etymology and history:**

The term "predictive modelling" originated from the field of statistics and
data analysis. The use of statistical models to make predictions has been
around for many years, but with the advent of advanced computing power and
increased availability of data, predictive modelling has become more
sophisticated and widely used in various industries.

**Summary:**

Predictive modelling is a technique used to make predictions about future
outcomes based on historical data. It involves creating a mathematical model
that captures the relationship between input variables and the output variable.
Predictive modelling has applications in various domains such as customer
churn prediction, credit scoring, and demand forecasting.
