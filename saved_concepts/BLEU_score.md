**Concept: BLEU Score**

The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a metric used to measure the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to human-generated translations. It provides a numerical value between 0 and 1, where a higher score indicates a better translation.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does BLEU score work?
   
   BLEU score compares the machine-generated translation with one or more human-generated translations. It counts the number of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n words) that appear in both the machine and human translations. The score is calculated based on the precision of these n-grams, considering both their presence and their order in the translations.

2. What does a BLEU score of 1 mean?
   
   A BLEU score of 1 means that the machine-generated translation is identical to the human-generated translation. However, it is rare to achieve a perfect score, as there are often multiple valid ways to translate a sentence.

**Example:**

Let's consider a simple example to understand BLEU score calculation. Suppose we have a machine-generated translation and two human-generated translations for the sentence "The cat is sitting on the mat."

Machine-generated translation: "The cat sits on the mat."
Human-generated translation 1: "The cat is sitting on the mat."
Human-generated translation 2: "On the mat, the cat is sitting."

To calculate the BLEU score, we compare the machine-generated translation with the two human-generated translations. We count the number of overlapping n-grams and calculate the precision.

In this case, let's consider 1-gram precision (unigrams). The machine-generated translation has 5 unigrams, out of which 4 are present in the first human-generated translation and 5 are present in the second human-generated translation. The precision is calculated as the ratio of the number of matching unigrams to the total number of unigrams in the machine-generated translation.

Precision for the first human-generated translation: 4/5 = 0.8
Precision for the second human-generated translation: 5/5 = 1.0

The BLEU score is the geometric mean of the precisions, considering different n-gram sizes. In this example, let's assume we only consider unigrams.

BLEU score = sqrt(0.8 * 1.0) = 0.894

**Summary:**

The BLEU score is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations. It compares the machine translation with one or more human translations, counting the number of overlapping n-grams. A higher BLEU score indicates a better translation, with a score of 1 representing a perfect match.
