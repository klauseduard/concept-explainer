### Concept Explanation:
Hyperparameter tuning is like adjusting the settings of a machine learning model to
get the best performance. It's like tweaking the knobs on a radio to find the
clearest signal.

### Follow-up Questions:
1. **How do we know which hyperparameters to tune?**
   - You can start with common hyperparameters like learning rate, number of
     trees in a random forest, or the depth of a neural network.

2. **How is hyperparameter tuning done?**
   - Techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are
     used to systematically explore different hyperparameter combinations.

### Example:
Let's say you're training a random forest model. You can tune hyperparameters
like the number of trees, maximum depth of trees, and minimum samples per leaf
to improve the model's accuracy.

### Etymology & History:
The term "hyperparameter tuning" originates from the field of machine learning.
It gained prominence with the rise of complex models like neural networks that
require careful tuning for optimal performance.

### Summary:
Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the settings of a machine learning
model to enhance its performance. It's like finding the best radio signal by
tweaking the knobs. Techniques like grid search and random search help in this
process.
