**Self-serving bias** is a psychological concept that refers to our tendency to
interpret and attribute our successes to internal factors, such as our own
abilities or efforts, while attributing our failures to external factors, such
as bad luck or other people's actions.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. Why do we have a self-serving bias?
2. How does self-serving bias affect our behavior?
3. Can you provide an example of self-serving bias?

**Answers:**

1. We have a self-serving bias because it helps us protect our self-esteem and
   maintain a positive self-image. By attributing our successes to our own
   abilities, we feel competent and in control. On the other hand, attributing
   failures to external factors allows us to avoid feelings of incompetence or
   inadequacy.

2. Self-serving bias can affect our behavior in several ways. It can lead us to
   take credit for our successes and downplay our failures, which can impact
   our relationships and interactions with others. It can also make it
   difficult for us to accurately assess our own strengths and weaknesses,
   potentially hindering personal growth and development.

3. An example of self-serving bias is when a software developer receives praise
   for completing a project ahead of schedule. They may attribute their success
   to their exceptional coding skills and efficient work habits. However, if
   the same developer misses a deadline, they may attribute it to external
   factors like unexpected technical issues or a lack of clear instructions.

**Etymology and history:**

The term "self-serving bias" was first introduced by social psychologists
Lee Ross and Andrew Ward in 1979. It emerged from their research on
attribution theory, which explores how individuals explain the causes of
events and behaviors. The concept gained recognition as researchers continued
to study the biases and cognitive processes that influence our self-perception
and judgments.

**Summary:**

Self-serving bias is a psychological tendency to attribute our successes to
internal factors and our failures to external factors. It helps protect our
self-esteem and maintain a positive self-image. This bias can impact our
behavior, relationships, and self-assessment. Understanding self-serving bias
can help us become more aware of our own biases and make more objective
evaluations.
