# Python Decorators Explained Simply

## What are Decorators?

Decorators in Python are a way to modify or enhance functions or methods without
changing their actual code. Think of them as wrappers that add extra functionality.

Imagine you have a function that adds two numbers, and you want to log every time this
function is called. Instead of changing the original function's code, you can use a decorator
to wrap it and add logging functionality.

## Follow-Up Questions

### What does a decorator look like?

A decorator is usually defined as a function that takes another function as an argument,
adds some functionality, and returns another function. Here’s a simple example:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### How do I use decorators?

You use the `@decorator_name` syntax above the function you want to decorate. This is
called a decorator application.

### Can decorators take arguments?

Yes, decorators can take arguments. To do this, you need to define another inner function
that will act as the actual decorator. Here’s an example:

```python
def repeat(n):
    def decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            for _ in range(n):
                func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@repeat(3)
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

### What are some common use cases for decorators?

Decorators are often used for:
- Logging: Recording when and how a function is called.
- Access control: Ensuring that only authorized users can access certain functions.
- Caching: Storing the results of expensive function calls to speed up future calls.

## Etymology and History

The term "decorator" in Python comes from the concept of decorating a function with
additional behavior. The idea was inspired by similar constructs in other programming
languages, such as method decorators in C#. In Python, decorators were introduced to
provide a clean and readable way to modify functions without altering their code directly.

## Summary

Decorators are a powerful feature in Python that allow you to add functionality to existing
functions or methods without modifying their code. They are defined using the `@decorator_name`
syntax and can take arguments, making them highly flexible. Decorators are commonly used for
logging, access control, caching, and more.
