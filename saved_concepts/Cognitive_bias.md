# Cognitive Bias: Simplified Explanation

Cognitive bias refers to the systematic errors in thinking that can affect our
judgment and decision-making. It is a tendency for our minds to perceive and
interpret information in a way that deviates from rationality or objectivity.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does cognitive bias impact decision-making?
2. What are some common examples of cognitive biases?

**Answers:**

1. Cognitive biases can impact decision-making by leading us to make
   irrational or flawed choices. These biases can influence how we perceive
   information, evaluate risks, and make judgments. They can lead us to
   overlook important details, rely on stereotypes, or make decisions based on
   emotions rather than facts.

2. Here are a few common examples of cognitive biases:

   - Confirmation Bias: This bias occurs when we seek out information that
     confirms our existing beliefs and ignore or downplay evidence that
     contradicts them. For example, a manager might only consider positive
     feedback about their team's performance and ignore any negative feedback.

   - Availability Heuristic: This bias happens when we rely on immediate
     examples or information that comes to mind easily when making judgments.
     For instance, a manager might overestimate the likelihood of a certain
     project failing because they recently heard about a similar project that
     did not succeed.

   - Anchoring Bias: This bias occurs when we rely too heavily on the first
     piece of information we receive when making decisions. For example, a
     manager might anchor their salary negotiation based on their previous
     salary, rather than considering the market value of their skills.

**Summary:**

Cognitive bias refers to the systematic errors in thinking that can impact our
decision-making. It can lead us to make irrational choices by influencing how
we perceive information and evaluate risks. Examples of cognitive biases
include confirmation bias, availability heuristic, and anchoring bias.
