**Cognitive Bias: Understanding Our Thinking Patterns**

Cognitive bias refers to the systematic errors or distortions in our thinking
processes that can lead us to make irrational judgments or decisions. It's like
wearing a pair of glasses that can sometimes make us see things in a skewed
way. These biases can affect how we perceive information, interpret situations,
and make judgments about ourselves and others.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How do cognitive biases affect our everyday lives?
   - Cognitive biases can influence our decision-making, problem-solving, and
     even our interactions with others. They can lead us to make snap judgments,
     overlook important information, or hold onto beliefs even when faced with
     contradictory evidence.

2. Why do we have cognitive biases?
   - Cognitive biases are a result of our brain's attempt to simplify and make
     sense of the overwhelming amount of information we encounter daily. Our
     brains rely on shortcuts or heuristics to process information quickly, but
     these shortcuts can sometimes lead to errors in judgment.

**Examples:**

1. Confirmation Bias: This bias occurs when we seek out information that
   confirms our existing beliefs and ignore or downplay evidence that contradicts
   them. For example, if someone strongly believes that vaccines are harmful,
   they may only pay attention to stories or articles that support this belief,
   while dismissing scientific studies that prove otherwise.

2. Anchoring Bias: This bias happens when we rely too heavily on the first piece
   of information we encounter when making decisions. For instance, when shopping
   for a new laptop, if we see a high-priced model first, we may perceive other
   laptops as cheaper or of lower quality, even if they are reasonably priced and
   meet our needs.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "cognitive bias" was coined by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel
Kahneman in the 1970s. They conducted extensive research on human judgment and
decision-making, which led to the development of the field of behavioral
economics. Their work highlighted the systematic errors in thinking that can
affect our decision-making processes.

**Summary:**

Cognitive biases are common thinking patterns that can lead us to make errors in
judgment or decision-making. They are a result of our brain's attempt to simplify
and process information quickly. Examples of cognitive biases include confirmation
bias and anchoring bias. Understanding these biases can help us become more aware
of our own thinking patterns and make more rational decisions.
