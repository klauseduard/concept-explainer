**Backpropagation** is a technique used in machine learning to train neural networks. It involves calculating and adjusting the weights of the network's connections to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

In simpler terms, backpropagation is like a feedback loop that helps the neural network learn from its mistakes. It works by comparing the network's output with the expected output and then making small adjustments to the weights of the connections between the neurons. These adjustments are made in a way that reduces the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. How does backpropagation know which weights to adjust?
   Backpropagation uses a mathematical technique called gradient descent to determine
   the direction and magnitude of the weight adjustments. It calculates the gradient
   (slope) of the error function with respect to each weight, and then adjusts the
   weights in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the error.

2. What is the error function?
   The error function is a mathematical function that measures the difference between
   the predicted output and the actual output. It quantifies how well the neural
   network is performing. The most commonly used error function is the mean squared
   error, which calculates the average squared difference between the predicted and
   actual outputs.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a neural network that is trained to recognize handwritten digits. During the training process, the network receives an image of a handwritten digit and predicts the corresponding digit (e.g., 5). If the predicted digit is incorrect (e.g., 3), backpropagation is used to adjust the weights of the connections in the network so that it can make a more accurate prediction next time.

Etymology and history:

The term "backpropagation" comes from the words "backwards" and "propagation." It was first introduced in the 1970s by Paul Werbos, who developed the concept as part of his research on neural networks. Backpropagation gained popularity in the 1980s when it was combined with the concept of gradient descent, leading to significant advancements in neural network training.

Summary:

Backpropagation is a technique used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights of their connections. It involves comparing the predicted output with the actual output and making small adjustments to minimize the difference between them. Backpropagation uses gradient descent to determine the direction and magnitude of the weight adjustments.
