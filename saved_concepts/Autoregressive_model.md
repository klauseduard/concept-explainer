**Autoregressive Model**

An autoregressive model is a type of statistical model that predicts future values based on past values of a time series. In simpler terms, it uses the pattern observed in historical data to make predictions about future data points.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does an autoregressive model work?
An autoregressive model uses a mathematical equation to represent the relationship between an observation and a number of lagged observations (previous values). It estimates the coefficients of this equation to make predictions.

2. What is a time series?
A time series is a sequence of data points collected over time, usually at regular intervals. Examples of time series include stock prices, temperature readings, and sales data.

3. How does an autoregressive model differ from other predictive models?
Autoregressive models specifically focus on the relationship between a variable and its past values. Other predictive models may consider additional factors or variables to make predictions.

**Example:**

Let's say we have daily temperature data for a city over the past month. We can use an autoregressive model to predict tomorrow's temperature based on the temperatures of the previous days. The model will analyze the patterns and relationships in the historical data to make an accurate prediction.

**Summary:**

An autoregressive model is a statistical model that uses past values of a time series to predict future values. It is useful for making predictions based on patterns observed in historical data.
