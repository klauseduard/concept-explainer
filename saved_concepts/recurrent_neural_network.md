# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is
designed to process sequential data. It is particularly useful when dealing
with data that has a temporal or sequential nature, such as time series data or
natural language.

RNNs are called "recurrent" because they have a feedback loop within their
architecture, allowing them to persist information from previous steps and use
it to make predictions or decisions at each new step. This feedback loop
enables RNNs to capture dependencies and patterns in sequential data.

## How does it work?

Imagine you are reading a sentence word by word and trying to understand its
meaning. At each word, you not only consider the current word but also rely on
the context of the previous words to comprehend the sentence. Similarly, an RNN
processes sequential data step by step, where each step corresponds to a
specific point in the sequence.

At each step, an RNN takes an input and produces an output, while also
maintaining a hidden state. The hidden state acts as the memory of the network,
allowing it to retain information from previous steps. This hidden state is
updated at each step based on the current input and the previous hidden state.

## Example

Let's say we have a language model that predicts the next word in a sentence.
Given the sentence "The cat is", the RNN takes the words "The", "cat", and "is"
one by one as inputs. At each step, it updates its hidden state based on the
current input and the previous hidden state. The hidden state captures the
context of the previous words. Finally, the RNN produces an output, which in
this case would be the predicted next word, such as "sleeping".

The RNN can be trained on a large dataset of sentences, learning to predict the
next word based on the context of the previous words. This allows it to generate
coherent and meaningful sentences.

## Etymology and History

The term "recurrent neural network" originates from the recurrent nature of the
network's architecture. The concept of RNNs was first introduced in the 1980s,
but they faced challenges in training due to the vanishing gradient problem,
which limited their effectiveness. In the early 1990s, the long short-term
memory (LSTM) architecture was proposed, which addressed the vanishing gradient
problem and greatly improved the performance of RNNs. Since then, various
variants of RNNs, such as Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), have been developed to
enhance their capabilities.

## Summary

In summary, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of neural network that
is designed to process sequential data by utilizing a feedback loop. It can
capture dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making it useful for
tasks like language modeling, speech recognition, and time series analysis.
