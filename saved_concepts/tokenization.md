**Tokenization** is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be individual words, phrases, or even characters. Tokenization is an important step in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks because it helps in understanding and analyzing text data.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. Why do we need to tokenize text?
Tokenization is necessary because it helps in converting unstructured text data into a structured format that can be easily processed by machines. By breaking down the text into tokens, we can analyze the frequency of words, identify patterns, and perform various operations like counting, filtering, or transforming the tokens.

2. How does tokenization work?
Tokenization algorithms use certain rules to determine where to split the text into tokens. The most common approach is to split the text at spaces or punctuation marks. However, tokenization can be more complex depending on the language and specific requirements of the task. For example, in some cases, tokenization may consider hyphenated words as a single token or split contractions into separate tokens.

**Example:**

Let's consider the sentence: "I love to eat pizza."

After tokenization, the sentence can be represented as a list of tokens: ["I", "love", "to", "eat", "pizza"].

**Summary:**

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens. It helps in converting unstructured text data into a structured format that can be easily processed by machines. Tokenization algorithms split the text based on certain rules, such as spaces or punctuation marks.
