# Orthogonal Architecture

Orthogonal architecture is a design approach in software development that
emphasizes the separation of concerns. It aims to organize the different
components of a system in a way that each component has a specific and
independent responsibility, without being tightly coupled to other components.

In simpler terms, think of orthogonal architecture as a way to break down a
complex system into smaller, self-contained parts that can be developed,
maintained, and tested independently. Each part focuses on a specific aspect of
the system's functionality, making it easier to understand and modify.

## Follow-up Questions:

**Q:** How does orthogonal architecture benefit software development?
**A:** Orthogonal architecture promotes modularity, reusability, and
maintainability. By separating concerns, it allows developers to work on
different components simultaneously, reduces the risk of unintended side
effects, and makes it easier to replace or update specific parts of the system.

**Q:** Can you provide an example of how orthogonal architecture is applied?
**A:** Sure! Let's consider a web application. In an orthogonal architecture, you
would have separate components for handling user authentication, data storage,
business logic, and user interface. Each component has a clear responsibility,
and changes made to one component won't affect the others as long as the
interfaces between them remain consistent.

**Q:** How does orthogonal architecture differ from other architectural styles?
**A:** Orthogonal architecture is similar to modular architecture, but it goes a
step further by enforcing a strict separation of concerns. It differs from
monolithic architecture, where all components are tightly coupled, and changes
in one part can have unintended consequences in other parts.

## Etymology and History:

The term "orthogonal" comes from mathematics, where it refers to the
independence of two variables or vectors. In software architecture, the concept
of orthogonality was popularized by David Parnas in the 1970s. Parnas advocated
for modular design and the separation of concerns, which laid the foundation
for orthogonal architecture.

## Summary:

Orthogonal architecture is a design approach that promotes the separation of
concerns in software development. It breaks down a complex system into
independent components, allowing for modularity, reusability, and
maintainability. Orthogonal architecture has its roots in the work of David
Parnas and has been widely adopted in modern software engineering practices.
