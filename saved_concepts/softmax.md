**Softmax** is a mathematical function commonly used in machine learning to
convert a set of numbers into probabilities. It takes an input vector and
transforms it into a probability distribution, where each element represents
the likelihood of that element being the most probable choice.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does softmax work?
   Softmax works by taking an input vector and applying an exponential function
   to each element. It then normalizes the resulting values by dividing each
   element by the sum of all exponential values. This normalization ensures
   that the output vector sums up to 1, representing a valid probability
   distribution.

2. What is the purpose of using softmax in machine learning?
   Softmax is often used in machine learning for tasks such as multi-class
   classification, where we want to assign a probability to each possible class
   label. It helps in determining the most likely class by converting raw
   scores or logits into probabilities.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a simple classification problem with three classes: cat,
dog, and bird. We have a model that predicts the following scores for each
class: cat (2.5), dog (1.8), bird (0.7). Applying softmax to these scores
gives us the following probabilities: cat (0.58), dog (0.29), bird (0.13).
These probabilities indicate that the model is most confident about the input
belonging to the cat class.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "softmax" is a combination of "soft" and "max." The "max" part refers
to the maximum function, which is used to determine the most probable class.
The "soft" part comes from the fact that softmax converts the raw scores into
a soft probability distribution.

Softmax was first introduced by the American mathematician Claude Shannon in
the 1940s as part of information theory. It gained popularity in machine
learning and neural networks during the 1980s and has since become a widely
used activation function.

**Summary:**

Softmax is a mathematical function used in machine learning to convert a set of
numbers into probabilities. It is commonly used for multi-class classification
tasks to determine the most likely class. Softmax takes an input vector, applies
an exponential function to each element, and normalizes the values to create a
probability distribution.
