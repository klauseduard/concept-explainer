### Concept Explanation:
In simple terms, a context window in software engineering refers to a specific
number of neighboring items around a particular item of interest. It helps
capture the surrounding context to understand the meaning or significance of
that item.

### Follow-up Questions:
1. **How is the size of a context window determined?**
   - The size of the context window is usually set based on the specific
     requirements of the task at hand. It can vary depending on factors like
     the nature of the data and the complexity of relationships to be
     captured.

2. **Can you provide an example of using a context window in natural language
   processing?**
   - In sentiment analysis, a context window of three words before and after a
     target word can help determine the sentiment expressed by that word in
     the given text.

### Etymology & History:
The term "context window" originates from the field of computational linguistics
and natural language processing. It has been widely used in various
applications where understanding the context of a specific element is crucial
for accurate analysis and processing.

### Summary:
In software engineering, a context window is a defined range of neighboring
items used to provide context for a specific element. It plays a vital role in
tasks like natural language processing, where understanding the context is
essential for accurate analysis.
