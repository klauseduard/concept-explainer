### Git Simplified Explanation for Junior Developers

Git is like a time machine for your code. It helps you keep track of all the
changes you make to your project, so you can go back to any version of your
code whenever you need to.

#### Follow-up Questions:

1. **How do I start using Git?**
   - To start using Git, you need to initialize a Git repository in your
     project folder using the command `git init`.

2. **What is a commit in Git?**
   - A commit is like taking a snapshot of your code at a specific point in
     time. It records the changes you've made and allows you to reference
     them later.

#### Examples:

1. Initializing a Git repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Making a commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   ```

### Etymology and History:

The term "Git" is British slang for a foolish or unpleasant person. It was
coined by Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, when he developed Git in 2005
as a distributed version control system to manage the Linux kernel development.

### Summary:

Git is a tool that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with
others effectively by providing a history of all modifications made to your
project.
