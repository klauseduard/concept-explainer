**Retrieval augmented generation** is a concept that combines two techniques in
natural language processing: retrieval and generation. In simple terms, it
involves using a retrieval model to find relevant information and then using a
generation model to generate a response based on that information.

When using retrieval augmented generation, the software developer might ask:

1. What is a retrieval model?
2. What is a generation model?
3. How are these two models combined?

1. A retrieval model is a model that is trained to find relevant information
   given a query. It works by searching through a large collection of data and
   returning the most relevant pieces of information based on the query.

2. A generation model is a model that is trained to generate human-like text
   based on a given prompt or input. It can be used to generate responses,
   summaries, or even complete articles.

3. In retrieval augmented generation, the retrieval model is used to find
   relevant information based on the input query. The retrieved information is
   then used as input to the generation model, which generates a response based
   on that information. This approach combines the benefits of both models,
   leveraging the retrieval model's ability to find relevant information and
   the generation model's ability to generate human-like responses.

Here's an example to illustrate retrieval augmented generation:

Let's say we have a chatbot that provides information about movies. When a user
asks, "What are some good action movies?", the retrieval model searches through
a database of movies and retrieves a list of action movies. This list is then
passed to the generation model, which generates a response like, "Here are some
good action movies: 'Die Hard', 'The Dark Knight', and 'Mad Max: Fury Road'."

**Etymology and History:**

The term "retrieval augmented generation" is a combination of two concepts:
retrieval and generation. The idea of using retrieval models to augment
generation models has gained popularity in recent years with the advancements
in natural language processing and the availability of large-scale datasets.

**Summary:**

Retrieval augmented generation combines retrieval and generation models to
provide more accurate and context-aware responses. It involves using a
retrieval model to find relevant information and a generation model to generate
a response based on that information. This approach enhances the capabilities
of conversational AI systems, making them more effective in understanding and
responding to user queries.
