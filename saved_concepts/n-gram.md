**Concept of n-gram:**

An n-gram is a sequence of n words or characters that appear together in a
given text. It helps us understand the relationship between words and the
context in which they occur. By analyzing n-grams, we can gain insights into
patterns, predict the next word in a sentence, or identify similarities between
texts.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. How does analyzing n-grams help us understand patterns?
2. Can you provide an example of how n-grams are used in language prediction?
3. How can n-grams be used to identify similarities between texts?

**Answers to the follow-up questions:**

1. Analyzing n-grams helps us understand patterns by examining the frequency
   of different sequences of words or characters. For example, if we analyze
   the n-grams in a set of customer reviews, we might find that the phrase
   "great customer service" appears frequently, indicating a positive pattern.
   This information can be used to improve customer service based on the
   identified patterns.

2. N-grams are commonly used in language prediction tasks. For instance, given
   the sentence "I want to eat ___," we can use n-grams to predict the next
   word. By analyzing a large corpus of text, we can determine that the most
   likely next word is "pizza" based on the frequency of the n-gram "eat
   pizza." This prediction can be used in various applications like text
   completion or chatbots.

3. N-grams can be used to identify similarities between texts by comparing the
   frequency of n-grams across different documents. For example, if we have a
   collection of news articles, we can analyze the n-grams in each article and
   compare them to find similar articles. By identifying common n-grams, we can
   determine which articles share similar topics or themes.

**Summary:**

N-grams are sequences of n words or characters that help us understand patterns,
predict the next word in a sentence, and identify similarities between texts.
Analyzing the frequency of n-grams provides valuable insights that can be used
to improve various natural language processing tasks.
