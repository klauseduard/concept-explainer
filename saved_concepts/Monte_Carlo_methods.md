**Monte Carlo methods** are a way to solve complex problems using random
sampling. Imagine you want to estimate the probability of a certain event
occurring, but it's too difficult to calculate directly. Instead, you can
simulate the event many times using random numbers and see how often it occurs.
By repeating this process many times, you can get a good approximation of the
probability.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. How does the simulation work?
2. How can we trust the results if they are based on random numbers?
3. Can you give an example of how Monte Carlo methods are used?

**Answers to the follow-up questions:**

1. In the simulation, we use random numbers to represent uncertain factors in
   the problem. We repeat the simulation many times, each time using different
   random numbers, and observe the outcomes. By analyzing the results, we can
   make inferences about the problem we are studying.
   
2. While the results are based on random numbers, the power of Monte Carlo
   methods lies in the fact that we repeat the simulation many times. This
   allows us to average out the randomness and obtain reliable estimates. The
   more simulations we run, the more accurate the results become.
   
3. Let's say we want to estimate the value of π (pi). We can use Monte Carlo
   methods by randomly generating points within a square and checking how many
   fall within a quarter of a circle inscribed in that square. By comparing the
   number of points inside the circle to the total number of points, we can
   estimate the value of π. The more points we generate, the closer our
   estimation will be to the actual value of π.

**Etymology and history:**

The term "Monte Carlo" refers to the famous casino city in Monaco known for its
gambling. The name was given to these methods because they involve the use of
randomness, similar to the unpredictability of gambling outcomes. The concept
of Monte Carlo methods was first introduced in the 1940s by scientists working
on the Manhattan Project, a research project to develop atomic weapons during
World War II. Since then, Monte Carlo methods have been widely used in various
fields, including physics, finance, and computer science.

**Summary:**

Monte Carlo methods are a technique for solving complex problems by using random
sampling. By simulating the problem many times and analyzing the results, we can
estimate probabilities and make informed decisions. Despite being based on random
numbers, the reliability of Monte Carlo methods increases with the number of
simulations performed.
