# Tragedy of the Commons

The Tragedy of the Commons is a concept that describes a situation where a
shared resource is depleted or degraded due to individual self-interest and
lack of coordination. It occurs when multiple individuals, acting
independently and rationally, deplete a common resource, leading to its
deterioration or exhaustion.

## Follow-up Questions:

1. How does this concept relate to the management of resources?
   
   The Tragedy of the Commons highlights the challenges of managing common
   resources, such as public lands, fisheries, or even digital resources like
   bandwidth. It shows that when individuals act solely in their own
   self-interest without considering the long-term consequences, it can lead
   to the depletion or degradation of the shared resource.

2. Can you provide an example to illustrate this concept?

   Sure! Let's consider a scenario where there is a pasture shared by multiple
   farmers. Each farmer can graze their livestock on the pasture. Initially,
   the pasture has enough grass to support all the animals. However, if each
   farmer increases the number of animals they graze to maximize their own
   profit, the pasture will eventually become overgrazed and unable to sustain
   any livestock. This is an example of the Tragedy of the Commons, where the
   self-interest of each farmer leads to the degradation of the shared
   resource.

## Etymology and History:

The term "Tragedy of the Commons" was coined by ecologist Garrett Hardin in
1968, in an influential paper of the same name. Hardin used the metaphor of a
common grazing area, or commons, to illustrate the concept. The idea of the
commons dates back to medieval times when land was often held in common by
villagers for grazing their livestock.

Hardin argued that when individuals have unrestricted access to a common
resource, they tend to exploit it to their advantage, leading to its
deterioration. He emphasized the need for collective action and regulation to
prevent the tragedy from occurring.

## Summary:

The Tragedy of the Commons refers to the depletion or degradation of a shared
resource due to individual self-interest and lack of coordination. It highlights
the challenges of managing common resources and emphasizes the need for
collective action and regulation to prevent their deterioration.
