**Activation Function**

An activation function is a mathematical function used in machine learning models, specifically in artificial neural networks. It determines whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs. In simpler terms, it decides whether the neuron should "fire" or not.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. Why do we need activation functions in neural networks?
   - Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn and model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Without activation functions, the neural network would simply be a linear model, which is limited in its ability to represent complex patterns and make accurate predictions.

2. What happens if we don't use an activation function?
   - Without an activation function, the output of each neuron would be a linear combination of its inputs, resulting in a neural network that can only learn linear relationships. This would severely limit the network's ability to solve complex problems.

**Example:**

Let's consider a simple neural network with one input neuron, one hidden neuron, and one output neuron. The activation function used in this example is the sigmoid function, which maps the weighted sum of inputs to a value between 0 and 1.

Input: 0.5
Weights: 0.8
Bias: 0.2

1. The input neuron receives the value 0.5.
2. The hidden neuron calculates the weighted sum: (0.5 * 0.8) + 0.2 = 0.6.
3. The activation function (sigmoid) is applied to the weighted sum: sigmoid(0.6) = 0.645.
4. The output neuron receives the value 0.645.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "activation function" comes from the field of neuroscience, where it refers to the process by which a neuron becomes active and transmits signals to other neurons. In the context of artificial neural networks, the concept of activation functions was introduced in the 1940s by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who developed the first mathematical model of an artificial neuron.

**Summary:**

In machine learning, an activation function determines whether a neuron should be activated or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs. It introduces non-linearity into neural networks, enabling them to learn complex patterns and make accurate predictions. Activation functions are essential for the success of neural networks in solving a wide range of problems.
