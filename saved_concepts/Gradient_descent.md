**Concept Explanation:**

Gradient descent is like finding the quickest way downhill. Imagine you are on a
mountain and want to reach the bottom as fast as possible. You take small steps
in the steepest direction downward until you reach the lowest point.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How do we know which direction is the steepest downhill?
   
   - In gradient descent, we calculate the gradient, which tells us the direction
     of the steepest increase. Moving in the opposite direction gives us the
     steepest decrease.

2. What are the steps involved in gradient descent?

   - The steps involve calculating the gradient of the function we want to
     minimize, moving in the opposite direction of the gradient, and updating
     the position iteratively until we reach the minimum.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a mathematical function that represents the error between
predicted and actual values in a machine learning model. Gradient descent helps
you adjust the model's parameters to minimize this error by iteratively moving
towards the minimum error.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "gradient descent" comes from the mathematical concept of a gradient,
which represents the rate of change of a function. The idea of gradient descent
has been around for a long time and is widely used in optimization algorithms.

**Summary:**

Gradient descent is a fundamental optimization technique used in machine
learning to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the
steepest decrease. It is like finding the quickest way downhill to reach the
lowest point.
