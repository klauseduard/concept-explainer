### Concept Explanation:
Batch normalization is like adjusting the ingredients of a recipe so that each step
of cooking produces the best result. In machine learning, it means normalizing
the input data in each batch to make training more stable and efficient.

### Follow-up Questions:
1. **How does batch normalization help in training neural networks?**
   Batch normalization helps by reducing internal covariate shift, making
   training faster and more stable. It allows using higher learning rates,
   leading to quicker convergence.

2. **Does batch normalization introduce any additional computational cost?**
   Yes, batch normalization adds some computational overhead during training,
   but the benefits in terms of faster convergence usually outweigh this cost.

### Example:
In a neural network for image classification, batch normalization can be applied
after each layer to normalize the activations. This helps in training the network
faster and achieving better accuracy.

### Etymology and History:
The term "batch normalization" was introduced by Sergey Ioffe and Christian
Szegedy in their 2015 paper. It quickly became a standard technique in training
deep neural networks due to its effectiveness in improving convergence and
generalization.

### Summary:
Batch normalization is a technique used in machine learning to normalize the
input data in each batch during training, leading to faster convergence and
more stable training of neural networks.
