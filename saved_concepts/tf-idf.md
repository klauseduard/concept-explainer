**Concept of tf-idf:**

Tf-idf stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency. It is a numerical
statistic that reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection
or corpus. The tf-idf value increases proportionally to the number of times a
word appears in a document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the
corpus. This helps to highlight words that are unique to a document and
downplay common words.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. How is tf-idf calculated?
2. What is the purpose of using tf-idf?
3. Can you provide an example of how tf-idf is used?

**Answers to the follow-up questions:**

1. Tf-idf is calculated by multiplying two values: term frequency (tf) and
inverse document frequency (idf). Term frequency is the number of times a word
appears in a document, while inverse document frequency is the logarithmically
scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain the word. The formula
for tf-idf is: tf-idf = tf * idf.

2. The purpose of using tf-idf is to determine the importance of a word in a
document relative to the entire corpus. It helps in identifying words that are
unique or significant to a particular document. Tf-idf is commonly used in
information retrieval, text mining, and natural language processing tasks.

3. Example: Let's say we have a collection of documents about animals, and we
want to find the most important words in each document. We can calculate the
tf-idf values for each word in each document. For instance, if the word "lion"
appears 5 times in a document that contains 100 words, and it appears in 10 out
of 1000 documents in the corpus, the tf-idf value for "lion" in that document
would be 5/100 * log(1000/10).

**Summary:**

Tf-idf is a measure of the importance of a word in a document relative to the
entire corpus. It helps to identify words that are unique or significant to a
particular document. By calculating the tf-idf values for each word, we can
highlight important words and downplay common words.
