**Prefrontal Cortex**

The prefrontal cortex is a part of the brain located at the front of the
forehead. It is responsible for higher cognitive functions, such as decision
making, problem-solving, planning, and controlling our behavior.

**Follow-up Questions:**

1. How does the prefrontal cortex affect decision making?
   - The prefrontal cortex helps us weigh different options, consider
     consequences, and make choices based on our goals and values. It helps us
     make rational decisions by considering both short-term and long-term
     outcomes.

2. Can damage to the prefrontal cortex affect our behavior?
   - Yes, damage to the prefrontal cortex can lead to changes in behavior. It
     can result in impulsivity, difficulty in controlling emotions, and
     impaired judgment. People with prefrontal cortex damage may struggle with
     planning, organizing, and regulating their behavior.

**Example:**

Imagine you are trying to decide whether to eat a healthy salad or indulge in a
delicious but unhealthy dessert. Your prefrontal cortex helps you consider the
benefits of eating healthy, such as maintaining a balanced diet and feeling
energized, as well as the potential negative consequences of indulging, such as
weight gain and feeling sluggish. It helps you make a decision that aligns with
your long-term health goals.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "prefrontal cortex" was first used by the French physician and
anatomist Paul Broca in the mid-19th century. He observed that this area of the
brain was located at the front (prefrontal) and distinguished it from other
regions. Since then, extensive research has been conducted to understand the
functions and importance of the prefrontal cortex in cognitive processes.

**Summary:**

The prefrontal cortex is a region of the brain responsible for higher cognitive
functions, including decision making, problem-solving, planning, and behavior
control. It helps us make rational choices by considering different options and
their consequences. Damage to the prefrontal cortex can lead to changes in
behavior and impairments in decision making.
