**Micromanagement** is a management style where a manager closely observes and
controls every aspect of their team's work. It's like a manager looking over
your shoulder and telling you exactly how to do your job, step by step.

**Follow-up question:** Why do managers micromanage?

**Answer:** Managers may micromanage for various reasons. Sometimes, they lack
trust in their team's abilities and feel the need to be involved in every
detail. Other times, they may have a perfectionist mindset and want things done
exactly their way. In some cases, managers may also feel insecure about their
own position and use micromanagement as a way to maintain control.

**Example:** Let's say you are a software developer working on a project. Your
manager constantly checks in on you, asking for updates multiple times a day,
and even dictates how you should write your code. They review every line of code
you write and make changes without consulting you. This excessive control and
lack of autonomy is a classic example of micromanagement.

**Follow-up question:** How does micromanagement affect software developers?

**Answer:** Micromanagement can have negative effects on software developers.
It can lead to decreased motivation and job satisfaction, as developers may feel
that their skills and expertise are not valued. Micromanagement can also hinder
creativity and innovation, as developers may be discouraged from trying new
approaches or suggesting improvements. Additionally, it can create a stressful
work environment, as developers may constantly feel under scrutiny and
pressured to meet unrealistic expectations.

**Example:** Imagine you are a software developer working on a new feature. Your
manager insists on reviewing every line of code you write, making constant
changes and suggesting minor tweaks. This constant interference slows down your
progress and makes you feel frustrated and demotivated.

**Etymology and History:**

The term "micromanagement" originated in the 1960s and combines the prefix
"micro-" (meaning small or minute) with "management." It gained popularity in
the business world in the 1980s and has since become a widely recognized term.

**Summary:**

Micromanagement is a management style where a manager closely monitors and
controls every aspect of their team's work. It can have negative effects on
software developers, such as decreased motivation, hindered creativity, and a
stressful work environment. The term "micromanagement" originated in the 1960s
and gained popularity in the 1980s.
