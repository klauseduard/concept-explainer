**Pandas** is a Python library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. It is specifically designed for working with structured data, such as tables or spreadsheets, and is widely used in the field of data science and machine learning.

Pandas introduces two main data structures: **Series** and **DataFrame**. A Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold any data type, such as numbers or strings. It is similar to a column in a spreadsheet. A DataFrame, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional table-like structure that consists of multiple Series. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table.

Pandas provides a wide range of functions and methods to manipulate and analyze data. You can perform operations like filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data with just a few lines of code. It also integrates well with other Python libraries, such as NumPy and Matplotlib, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization.

**Follow-up questions:**

1. How can I install pandas?
   - You can install pandas using the Python package manager, pip. Open your
     command prompt or terminal and run the command `pip install pandas`.

2. How do I create a DataFrame in pandas?
   - You can create a DataFrame by passing a dictionary or a list of lists to
     the `pd.DataFrame()` function. For example:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     data = {'Name': ['John', 'Jane', 'Mike'],
             'Age': [25, 30, 35],
             'City': ['New York', 'London', 'Paris']}

     df = pd.DataFrame(data)
     ```

3. How can I filter data in a DataFrame?
   - You can filter data in a DataFrame by using boolean indexing. For example,
     to filter rows where the age is greater than 30:
     ```python
     filtered_df = df[df['Age'] > 30]
     ```

**Etymology and history:**

The name "pandas" is derived from "panel data," which refers to multidimensional structured data sets. The library was developed by Wes McKinney and first released in 2008. It was initially inspired by the functionality of the R programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Since its release, pandas has gained popularity and has become an essential tool in the data science and machine learning community.

**Summary:**

Pandas is a Python library that provides easy-to-use data structures and tools for working with structured data. It introduces the concepts of Series and DataFrame, which allow you to manipulate and analyze data efficiently. Pandas is widely used in the field of data science and machine learning due to its simplicity and powerful functionality.
