Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns
from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. In this approach, the
algorithm is provided with a set of input data along with their corresponding
correct outputs. The algorithm then learns to map the inputs to the outputs by
finding patterns and relationships in the data.

Follow-up questions:

1. How does supervised learning work?
Supervised learning works by training an algorithm using a labeled dataset.
The algorithm analyzes the input data and tries to find patterns or
relationships between the inputs and the corresponding outputs. Once trained,
the algorithm can then make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

2. What are some examples of supervised learning?
One example is email spam detection. The algorithm is trained using a dataset
of emails labeled as spam or not spam. It learns to recognize patterns in the
emails that indicate whether they are spam or not. Once trained, the algorithm
can classify new emails as spam or not spam.

Another example is image recognition. The algorithm is trained using a dataset
of images labeled with their corresponding objects or categories. It learns to
identify patterns and features in the images that help it recognize objects or
categories in new, unseen images.

Etymology and history:
The term "supervised learning" comes from the idea that the algorithm is
supervised or guided by the labeled data during the learning process. The
concept of supervised learning has been around since the early days of machine
learning. It has its roots in the field of statistics and has been extensively
studied and developed over the years.

Summary:
Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where an algorithm learns
from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. It works by finding
patterns and relationships in the data and using them to make predictions on
new, unseen data. Examples include email spam detection and image recognition.
