# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns
from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. In this approach, we have
a dataset that consists of input variables (features) and corresponding output
variables (labels). The goal is to train a model that can accurately predict
the output variable for new, unseen input data.

## Example

Let's say we want to build a model that can predict whether an email is spam
or not. We would start by collecting a dataset of emails, where each email is
labeled as either spam or not spam. Each email in the dataset would have
features such as the subject, sender, and content of the email. The label
would be either "spam" or "not spam".

We would then use this labeled dataset to train a supervised learning model.
The model would learn patterns and relationships between the features of the
emails and their corresponding labels. Once the model is trained, we can use it
to predict whether new, unseen emails are spam or not.

## Follow-up Questions

**Q1: How does the model learn from the labeled data?**

The model learns from the labeled data by finding patterns and relationships
between the input features and the output labels. It tries to find the best
function that maps the input features to the output labels.

**Q2: What types of algorithms are used in supervised learning?**

There are various algorithms used in supervised learning, such as decision
trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks. Each
algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of algorithm
depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the dataset.

**Q3: How do we measure the performance of a supervised learning model?**

The performance of a supervised learning model is typically measured using
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics
provide an indication of how well the model is able to make correct predictions
on unseen data.

## Summary

Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where an algorithm learns
from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. It involves training a
model using input features and corresponding output labels. The model learns
patterns and relationships in the data and can be used to predict the output
for new, unseen data.
